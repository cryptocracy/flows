# Flow
This repo is basically just a node-red flow for you to import into your node-red instance to turn it into a Preferred Server node

# Requirements:

The server needs to have node-red, redis, and blockstack installed.

# Required nodes:

node-red-contrib-redis

node-red-contrib-auth

# Warning:

For these api end points to be used, the client application (Souq) must have the path to the server saved in its configuration.
